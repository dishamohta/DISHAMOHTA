	<h2> { cool things and all that }</h2>

	<p> Hey, Welcome to my site!
	My name is Disha Mohta. I am an aspiring computer scientist with <br>
	an interest in <b>Philosophy, Writing and Mathematics </b>. So whats my story? I was born in Kolkata,
	<br> India and moved to Singapore at the age of 5
	Since then, I have lived in Indonesia and now I am back<br> in Singapore!
  Over the next few months, I plan on making as many
	projects as possible, learning new <br>languages and becoming a fluent programmer and hopefully that
	will go well. I enjoy programming, <br>meeting new people and reading exciting books </p>

	<h3>  <b>More About Me<b> </h3>

	<p id="more">
		About a year ago, I got hooked onto a famous show loved by most
		programmers and computer enthusiasts<br> - Silicon Valley and fell
		in love. Since then, over the past 6 months I have met 3 really
		influential seniors who<br> have inspired me to pursue Computer Science.


		I read Homosapiens, an extremely thorough and thought provoking<br> read
		and after being convinced took a Philosophy course which has since
		then helped me understand myself in<br> a deeper manner.

		Over the past year, I did a hackathon, came third but then didn't go about
		really pursuing the<br> project. Right now, I am working on a cool new project
		for students my age and I am excited to take this out <br>in the near future.

		<br> <br> <br>
		Right now I am using my spare time, to build new projects, ideate, meet <br>
		cool new people and invest time in what I love doing. Moreover, I love working with
		other especially during SHEHacks,<br> the annual high school all girls hackathon my friends
		and I organise. I feel motivated and empowered to learn more, read <br> more and know more!
